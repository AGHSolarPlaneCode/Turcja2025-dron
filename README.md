This project is a drone control system for aerial photography and data collection. It includes the source code for the drone's flight controller and image processing scripts.

### Installation

I highly recommend creating a new Python **virtual environment** to manage project dependencies. This prevents conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

#### **Steps**

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AGHSolarPlaneCode/Turcja2025-dron.git
    cd Turcja2025-dron
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
